Writing lots of code
Storing data in files
Making copies of those
Doesn't give a lot of smiles

Every version is different
Your team can't collaborate
Not very pleaseant
And slow development rate

Thus GIT the VCS comes along
Versions all of your files
Setup doesn't take too long
And saves lots of time

Create a new repository
Using git init
Don't worry
Next comes your first commit

With git add *
You can add all your files
However don't forget
.gitignore holds all of the exiled

Now you can git commit
Add a message to it
git push off to the remote
And hope there are no merge conflicts abroad

With git pull
Get your version up to date
Your own progress can be different with git branch
And later git merge is never too late
