# GIT IT

Writing lots of code <br>
Storing data in files <br>
Making copies of those <br>
Doesn't give a lot of smiles <br>

Every version is different <br>
Your team can't collaborate <br>
Not very pleaseant <br>
And slow development rate <br>

Thus **GIT** the VCS comes along <br>
Versions all of your files <br>
Setup doesn't take too long <br>
And saves lots of time <br>

Create a new repository <br>
Using *git init* <br>
Don't worry <br>
Next comes your first commit <br>

With *git add* \* <br>
You can add all your files <br>
However don't forget <br>
*.gitignore* holds all of the exiled <br>

Now you can *git commit* <br>
Add a message to it <br>
*git push* off to the remote <br>
And hope there are no merge conflicts abroad <br>

With *git pull* <br>
Get your version up to date <br>
Your own progress can be different with *git branch* <br>
And later *git merge* is never too late <br>
