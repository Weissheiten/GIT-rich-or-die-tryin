Everything is blue
Like the code you do
So never stop what you do
When you hear the BluecodeBlues

Blue is the color of faith
Then there is always a little left for you
If you stick to the BluecodeBlues
And it goes like this!

When I am alone i can relay on my BluecodeBlues
It helps me to get back to programming skills
It helps me to regain my power
Than I am unstoppable with BluecodeBlues power
