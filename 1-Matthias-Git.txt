Start your jounrey with git init
For adding your files to it
Use git add, what a slap

If you want to make a snapshot of your repository
Just go for it, with git commit
Make commits regulary
Than better save often and early

To upload content from your local repository
Into your remote repository
You only need on little command
Git push, for the win

To get the latest version of the repository
Just use git pull
For versioning in your repository
Start it with git tag

The best VCS is git
We all just love it
So one last advice in the end
Use git!
